A full industry replacement set NewGRF for the game OpenTTD.
This mod replaces the existing industry set with a new industry chain that mimics the real-world logistics of producing estrogen and testosterone.
It includes 17 new industries, 18 new cargos, and a new game mechanic which revolves around consistent service to industries, and incentivizes reliability in networks, rather than throughput.

Engineering Supplies / Farm Supplies cargo boosting mechanic blatantly copied from the FIRS NewGRF by @andythenorth, which can be found here: https://github.com/andythenorth/firs

Mod (and this README, clearly) are WIP.
Sprites are placeholders and frankensteined from the OpenTTD base graphics set.

Compilation command: `nmlc --grf mygrf.grf mygrf.nml`
